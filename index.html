	I have been with Apple for about four and a half years now. I am currently an Operations Specialist but spent a year as a Technical Specialist. Having these two jobs under my belt has really helped me gain knowledge of front end and back end all store operations. It has also given me knowledge of the full customer journey.

	Working in Backstage, I have a keen sense of what needs to take priority and what needs to be done first. My strengths are prioritization, learning on the fly, Problem solving, etc. I am extremely humorous as well as being positive in stressful situations. When I first moved to Backstage three years ago, the following NPP went from a negative 40 to a 70.

	As an Operations Specialist, I deal with inventory and organization on a daily basis. My passion for troubleshooting spacial problems and optimizing the storage we have is one of my favorite job duties. I like to do things in a speedy and organized manner. I had the most runner fulfillments in my store for a minimum of two quarters.

	When I was a technician here at Apple, I spent my days troubleshooting software and hardware. I used my knowledge to find the best and most efficient solution for every user and make sure they left with a new skill or tip from our appointment. I ended my time in the Genius Bar/Forum with the highest customer NPS out of the entire team. </li><br>
